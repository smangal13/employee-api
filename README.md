# employee-api
A backend Server using FastAPI in Python. Creating an Employee Data store, with in-memory storage. Creating API endpoints for CRUD operations.


# Documentation:
This Employee Management API provides an easy-to-use platform for managing employee data. It allows users to create, read, update, and delete (CRUD operations) employee information. The data is stored in-memory, meaning that it is not persisted beyond the runtime of the API server. 
The API is built using FastAPIâ€”a modern web framework for building APIs with Python. FastAPI is designed for performance and ease of use. 

# 1. System Requirements
  Python 3.7 or higher
  pip package manager
  Git for version control
  VSCode or any other text editor for writing and editing code

# 2. Installation Instructions
  ## Step 1: Install Python 3 (if not already installed)
  Check if Python 3 is already installed by running the following command in the terminal:
    ```bash
    python3 --version
  If Python 3 is not installed, download and install it from the official website: python.org.
  ## Step 2: Install Git (if not already installed)
  Verify if Git is installed:
    git --version
  If Git is not installed, download and install it from git-scm.com.
  ## Step 3: Set Up Virtual Environment
  To create a Python 3 virtual environment, follow these steps:
    Open the terminal.
    Navigate to the project directory (where you want to store your project).
    Run the following command to create a new virtual environment:
      python3 -m venv venv
  ## Step 4: Install Required Packages
  Once the virtual environment is created, activate it:
    source venv/bin/activate  
  Install the necessary packages (fastapi,pydantic and uvicorn):
    pip install fastapi uvicorn
    pip install pydantic

# 3. API Endpoints
  ## 1. Add Employee
    Endpoint: POST /employeeData
    Adds a new employee to the in-memory database.
  ## 2. Get All Employees
    Endpoint: GET /employeeData
    Returns a list of all employees stored in memory.
  ## 3. Get Employee by ID
    Endpoint: GET /employeeData/{employee_id}
    Retrieves a specific employee's information based on their id.
    Path Parameter: employee_id
  ## 4. Update Employee
    Endpoint: PUT /employeeData/{employee_id}
    Updates all details of an employee except their id.
    Path Parameter: employee_id
  ## 5. Update Specific Employee
    Endpoint: PATCH /employeeData/{employee_id}
    Updates only the specific fields of an employee. The id cannot be updated.
    Path Parameter: employee_id
  ## 6. Delete Employee
    Endpoint: DELETE /employeeData/{employee_id}
    Deletes an employee's data from the in-memory list.
    Path Parameter: employee_id

# 4. Testing and Running the API
  ## Step 1: Run the FastAPI Server
  To run the FastAPI server, use Uvicorn:
    uvicorn main:app --reload
  This starts the server on http://127.0.0.1:8000.
  The environment needs to be active and you need to be in the directory where the code is stored in your system. 
  ## Step 2: Test Endpoints with cURL (Manual Testing)
  To test using cURL open a new terminal and run the following codes to test each API endpoint.
  
  ### Add Employee:
    Code:
    curl -X POST http://127.0.0.1:8000/employeeData \
      -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
      -d '{"id": 1, "name": "John Doe", "department": "Engineering", "position": "Software Engineer", "salary": 75000}'
    
    Expected Output:
    {
      "message": "Employee Data Successfully stored!",
      "employee": {
        "id": 1,
        "name": "John Doe",
        "department": "Engineering",
        "position": "Software Engineer",
        "salary": 75000
      }
    }
    
  ### Get All Employees:
    Code:
    curl -X GET http://127.0.0.1:8000/employeeData \
      -H "Content-Type: application/json"
    
    Expected Output: A JSON array of Employees
    [
      {
        "id": 1,
        "name": "John Doe",
        "department": "Engineering",
        "position": "Software Engineer",
        "salary": 75000
      }
    ]
    
  ### Get Employee by ID:
    Code:
    curl -X GET http://127.0.0.1:8000/employeeData/1 \
      -H "Content-Type: application/json"
    
    Expected Output:
    If the employee exists:
    {
      "id": 1,
      "name": "John Doe",
      "department": "Engineering",
      "position": "Software Engineer",
      "salary": 75000
    }
    
    If the employee does not exist:
    {
      "detail": "Employee with the given employee_id not found"
    }
    
  ### Update Employee:
    Code:
    curl -X PUT http://127.0.0.1:8000/employeeData/1 \
      -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
      -d '{"id": 1, "name": "John Doe", "department": "Engineering", "position": "Senior Software Engineer", "salary": 80000}'
      
    Expected Output:
    If the employee exists:
    {
      "message": "Employee data Successfully Updated",
      "employee": {
        "id": 1,
        "name": "John Doe",
        "department": "Engineering",
        "position": "Senior Software Engineer",
        "salary": 80000
      }
    }
    
    If the employee does not exist:
    {
      "detail": "Employee with the given employee_id not found"
    }
    
  ### Update Specific Employee Details:
    Code:
    curl -X PATCH http://127.0.0.1:8000/employeeData/1 \
      -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
      -d '{"salary": 85000}'
      
    Expected Output:
    If the employee exists:
    {
      "message": "Employee data Successfully Updated",
      "employee": {
        "id": 1,
        "name": "John Doe",
        "department": "Engineering",
        "position": "Senior Software Engineer",
        "salary": 85000
      }
    }
    
    If the employee does not exist:
    {
      "detail": "Employee with the given employee_id not found"
    }
    
  ### Delete Employee:
    Code:
    curl -X DELETE http://127.0.0.1:8000/employeeData/1 \
      -H "Content-Type: application/json"
    
    Expected Output:
    {
      "message": "Employee data Successfully Deleted"
    }
    
  ## Step 3: Test Using SwaggerUI (Optional)
  Perform the same test as Step 2, by using SwaggerUI instead of cURL.
    Access Swagger UI: Open a browser and go to http://127.0.0.1:8000/docs.
    Interact with the API: Use the "Try it out" button for each endpoint, provide the required data, and click "Execute" to test each endpoint.
    Review the responses: Swagger UI will show the output directly in the interface, including successful and error responses.

  ## Step 4: Unit Testing Using Pytest
    1. Download the necessary dependencies:
      pip install pytest pytest-asyncio
    
    2. Running Tests:
      To run a specific test file, use:
        pytest test_main.py
      To run a specific test within the file:
        pytest -k "test_function_name" test_main.py

    3. Output Display: (Optional)
        To display verbose output:
          pytest -v
        To generate coverage report:
          pip install pytest-cov
          pytest --cov=. test_main.py
        To generate HTML test report:
          pip install pytest-html
          pytest test_main.py --html=report.html --self-contained-html
          open report.html
